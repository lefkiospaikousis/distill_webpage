This is a reminder to myself (and to whoever finds this useful) on the calculation of:   

- the [Standardised Mortality Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_mortality_ratio)  (SMR)  
- The Confidence Interval of the SMR


## What you can learn    

What you can learn in this reminder  

- Some use of regular expressions
- creating functions and use them to avoid repeat myself
- Read (multiple) excel data into R 
- Function programming basics using the package [purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/), [intro](https://towardsdatascience.com/functional-programming-in-r-with-purrr-469e597d0229), [usefull](https://www.hvitfeldt.me/blog/purrr-tips-and-tricks/)
- The `rowwise` function
- `list.files` function and the `set_names` from `purrr` to make it easy to map the files into functions and keep a record of what comes from 


## The SMR

The SMR is calculated as the ratio of observed hospital mortality over predicted hospital mortality.    

I have data on ~1000 patients of the iCU and the following info:

- SAPS II score
- ICU mortality (death/alive)

The data are in separate `.rds` file my working directory


## Read file

```{r READ FILES}

library(tidyverse)

location <- "_posts/2019-05-10-standardised-mortality-ratio/"

dta <- readRDS(here::here(location, "dta.rds"))

```


Here is a bit of an output

```{r}

dta %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

## Aggregate    

Lets aggregate by year, the observed mortality, and the median SAPS II score  

```{r aggregation}

  dta_aggr = 
  dta %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    summarise(n = n(),
              obs_mortality = sum(death),
              mortality_rate = mean(death),
              # I get the median SAPS score
              med_saps = median(saps_ii)
              ) 

  dta_aggr %>% knitr::kable()

```


Now I need to calculate the predicted mortality by year.    
The predicted mortality is [derived from the SAPS II score](https://clincalc.com/IcuMortality/SAPSII.aspx) as follows:  

$logit = -7.7631 + 0.0737*Score + 0.9971*ln(Score+1)$

and then   

$Mortality = \frac{e^{logit}}{1+e^{logit}}$


Here I need a function that has the saps II score as an input and returns the predicted mortality   


```{r predict-mortality-function}
predict_mortality = function(score){
  logit = -7.7631 + 0.0737 * score + 0.9971 * log(score+1)
  mortality = exp(logit)/ (1+exp(logit))
  return(mortality)
}
```

Now lets use our function `predict_mortality` to calculate the predicted mortality out of the SAPS II score    

```{r}

  smr_table = 
  dta_aggr %>% 
    mutate(pred_mortality_rate = predict_mortality(med_saps),
           # get expecte counts of deaths
           pred_mortality = pred_mortality_rate * n,
           # The SMR 
           smr = obs_mortality/ pred_mortality) 

  #Have  a look
  smr_table %>% knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```


## The Confidence Interval

An approximate 95% confidence interval (CI) for the SMR was calculated by using the method proposed by __Vandenbroucke JP. A shortcut method for calculating the 95 percent confidence interval of the standardized mortality ratio. (Letter). Am J Epidemiol 1982; 115:303-4.__  

I found the formulas of all possible CI calculations for the SMR [here](https://www.openepi.com/PDFDocs/SMRDoc.pdf). It is the documentation of the [this](http://web1.sph.emory.edu/users/cdckms/exact-midP-SMR.html) and [this](https://www.openepi.com/SMR/SMR.htm) online calculators


I tried out a few formulas in the documentation, specifically the ones that are called _approximations_

I haven't tried the Exact Tests calculations - I think they need more programming + I couldn't figure out how I am supposed to do the iterative process. Perhaps its easy and don't have time to think about it :)


Well i tried this approximation by Vanderbroucke    

![](smr_confidence_interval.png)

Beware that the $\sqrt(α)$ refers to the observed mortality and the $λ$ to the predicted mortality. DO NOT confuse with the $α$ of the Z score (i.e. the 1.96)


So I created this function, that reads the observed and predicted mortality (actual counts) and returns a vector of 2 values. The 1st is the lower limit, and  the 2nd the upper limit   


```{r}
smr_conf =  function(observed, predicted){
  
  lower = ((sqrt(observed) - 1.96*0.5)^2)/ predicted
  upper = ((sqrt(observed) + 1.96*0.5)^2)/ predicted
  
  return(c(lower, upper))
  
}
```

Now lets use the `smr_table` we calculated earlier   

__NOTE HERE the use of__ `rowwise` function of `dplyr`    

The `rowwise` is needed since the inputs to the the function are taken rowwise    

```{r}

smr_table %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate( lower_95 = smr_conf(obs_mortality, pred_mortality)[1],
          upper_95 = smr_conf(obs_mortality, pred_mortality)[2]) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)

```
