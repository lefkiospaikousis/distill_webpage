Here I will outline a collection of tips for using CSS to tweak the UI of a shiny app.   

I find myself looking on Google for the same things, over and over again, so I decided to create a post to outline all the tips and tricks or resources when I want to do something with CSS on my Shiny app. 

I also hope that other people will benefit from this.


### Center a button

OMG.. how many times I need to search for this

tl;dr

`actionButton("go", "Go", style = "display:block; margin:0 auto")`

This is the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/css.html#:~:text=pros%20and%20cons.-,Inline%20CSS,-The%20quickest%20and" target="_blank">inline</a> style.    

The best is to use the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/css.html#:~:text=file%2Dbased%20workflow.-,File%2Dbased%20CSS,-/*%20Get%20a%20fancy" target="_blank">File-based CSS</a>

Let's say we add a class to the button called `.center`    

```
actionButton("go", "Go", class = ".center')

```
and on the CSS file, we add:   

```

.center{
  
  display:block; 
  margin: 0 auto;
}
