I am\r\ndedicated to turning research and business data into knowledge.\r\nI collaborate with both the private sector, for data analysis -\r\nstatistical programming - visualisation, and academic researchers with\r\nsurvey design and analysis.\r\nMy core competencies are:\r\nStatistical computing: I can identify and analyze trends or\r\npatterns in data sets through the use of the statistical computing language\r\nR.\r\nReproducibility: I can create reports in Rmarkdown documents.\r\nRmarkdown enables reproducibility and knowledge sharing in an effective\r\nmanner.\r\nData and database wrangling: I have extensive knowledge of the\r\ndplyr package in R. Dplyr is the grammar of data manipulation and part\r\nof the tidyverse collection of R packages designed for data\r\nscience.\r\nVisualisations: Very good knowledge of the ggplot2 package in R.\r\nGgplot2 is an advanced plotting system for R based on the grammar of\r\ngraphics.\r\nWeb applications: I build interactive web apps using the shiny framework\r\nExcel Modelling: Developed the ImproRisk model - a tool for conducting\r\ndeterministic dietary risk assessment analysis. It is built in MS Excel\r\nutilising a series of excel functions and VBA syntax. It is now being\r\nused by several European risk assessment authorities.\r\nTraining: Im an accredited trainer by the Cyprus Authority of the Developemnt of\r\nHuman Resources\r\nSurvey design, data collection and analysis: Expertise in\r\ndesigning surveys.
